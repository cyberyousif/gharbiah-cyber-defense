    <!-- WHY CYBERSECURITY MATTERS (NEW SECTION) -->
    <section class="why-matters">
      <h2>Why Cybersecurity Matters</h2>

      <p>
        Every year, individuals and businesses experience data loss, account takeovers,
        or device compromise due to common issues like weak passwords, unsafe Wi-Fi,
        phishing messages, or missing protections.
      </p>

      <p class="stat">
        <strong>
          Most cybersecurity incidents don’t rely on advanced hacking techniques. In fact, over 80% of data breaches involve compromised credentials, weak access controls, or basic security misconfigurations, according to the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR).
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        These risks affect everyday users and organizations alike and often occur
        without warning.
      </p>

      <p class="cta-text">
        Gharbiah Cyber Defense helps individuals and businesses reduce these risks
        through practical cybersecurity services designed to prevent problems
        before they happen.
